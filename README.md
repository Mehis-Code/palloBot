# palloBot
(Bot is made for my use and learning purposes)

Funny side project for a discord bot done with discord.js.
Used for searching a random message in a random channel by a specified user.
Hope my friends aren't embarrassed by what they have posted :)

// I learned a lot about reading documentation and building something small for my own use instead of a school project. Very useful
and fun to build as the project was made from a friend's funny remark
